This Repository is the complete catalog of my work in a book titled, Zed Shaw: Learn Python the Hard Way, exercises.

I started this book in mid-Dec, 2020 and am currently working through it.

Anything titled ex().py should be the original example that is given in the book. Anything with ex()().py are modifications to the original files. 
Shaw tells users of his book to modify/experiment with the files in various ways and I also like to see what I can and can not do to the files to make
them run or pull an error.

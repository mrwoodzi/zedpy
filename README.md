This Repository is the current catalog of my work in a book titled, Zed Shaw: Learn Python the Hard Way, exercises.

I started this book in mid-Dec, 2020 and am presently working through it.

Anything titled ex().py should be the original example that is given in the book. Anything with ex()_().py are modifications to the original files. 
Shaw tells users of his book to modify/experiment with the files in various ways to see if they will run or pull an error.

Please excuse the sophmoric humor and 80's throw back trivia that is found in some of my code.

1/30/2021: I have really enjoyed Zed's book and as of this date am on ex32.py. I am officially working out of 3 main resources, 2 books and 1 internet source, freecodecamp.org.
    freecodecamp.org has been one of the best resources that I have found to date and has been a great companion to all the exercises I have been doing up to this point.
